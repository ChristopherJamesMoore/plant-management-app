## Plant management app ğŸŒ±
Over the past few years I have collected a number of house plants that, due to work and other commitments, have mostly died.. Because of this, I attempted to find and use a plant management app on the iOS store. These all unfortunately are hidden under pay walls. I decided to solve this issue by creating my own app free from pay walls.
